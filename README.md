# Personal Front-End Developer Portfolio

## About The Project
This project was built to showcase my front-end developer personal projects. Building my portfolio from scratch gave me the ability to display the technical and web design skills I have learned. I was able to implement JavaScript functions and CSS selectors I was not previously familiar with.
- Portfolio will be frequently updated with new projects.

### Built With
* HTML
